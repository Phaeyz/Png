# PngMetadata.GetFirstOrCreate&lt;T&gt; method (1 of 2)

Gets the first chunk of the specified type in the PNG metadata, or creates a new one if it does not exist.

```csharp
public T GetFirstOrCreate<T>(bool repositionExistingChunk, 
    IEnumerable<ChunkType> precedingChunkTypes)
    where T : Chunk, new()
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The type of chunk to get or create. |
| repositionExistingChunk | If `true` and the chunk already exists, it will be repositioned according to the *precedingChunkTypes* array. If `false`, the existing chunk will not be repositioned. An image-header chunk is always implied to be in this array. |
| precedingChunkTypes | When creating or repositioning, ensures the chunk is placed after the last chunk matching any of the types. |

## Return Value

A chunk which was found or created of the requested type.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| [PngException](../PngException.md) | A chunk was found, but the class type did not match the expected type. |

| --- | --- |
| T | The type of chunk to get or create. |
| repositionExistingChunk | If `true` and the chunk already exists, it will be repositioned according to the *precedingChunkTypes* array. If `false`, the existing chunk will not be repositioned. An image-header chunk is always implied to be in this array. |
