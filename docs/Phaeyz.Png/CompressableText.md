# CompressableText class

Supports a delayed deserialization of non-null terminated and potentially compressed UTF-8 text within chunks. Also supports efficiently reserializing.

```csharp
public class CompressableText
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [CompressableText](CompressableText/CompressableText.md)() | Initializes a new [`CompressableText`](./CompressableText.md) instance. |
| [CompressableText](CompressableText/CompressableText.md)(…) | Initializes a new [`CompressableText`](./CompressableText.md) instance. |
| [CompressionMethod](CompressableText/CompressionMethod.md) { get; set; } | The compression method. |
| [IsCompressed](CompressableText/IsCompressed.md) { get; set; } | Indicates whether or not the text should be compressed when serialized. |
| [Text](CompressableText/Text.md) { get; set; } | The text field. |
| [ValidateAndComputeLength](CompressableText/ValidateAndComputeLength.md)() | Validates the text is ready for serialization, and computes the data length of the chunk. |
| [WriteTextToStreamAsync](CompressableText/WriteTextToStreamAsync.md)(…) | Writes the text data to the stream. |
| static [FromStreamAsync](CompressableText/FromStreamAsync.md)(…) | Reads a specific number of bytes from a stream and assigns to a new [`CompressableText`](./CompressableText.md) instance. |
