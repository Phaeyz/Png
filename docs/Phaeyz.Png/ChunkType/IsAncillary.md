# ChunkType.IsAncillary property

Gets whether the chunk is ancillary or critical.

```csharp
public bool IsAncillary { get; }
```

## Remarks

Critical chunks are necessary for successful display of the contents of the datastream, for example the image header chunk (IHDR). A decoder trying to extract the image, upon encountering an unknown chunk type in which is not ancillary (critical), shall indicate to the user that the image contains information it cannot safely interpret.  Ancillary chunks are not strictly necessary in order to meaningfully display the contents of the datastream, for example the time chunk (tIME). A decoder encountering an unknown chunk type which is ancillary can safely ignore the chunk and proceed to display the image.
