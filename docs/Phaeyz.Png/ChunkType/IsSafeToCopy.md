# ChunkType.IsSafeToCopy property

Indicates the chunk may be safely copied to a new PNG data stream even if the image data is changed and the encoder does not understand this chunk type.

```csharp
public bool IsSafeToCopy { get; }
```

## Remarks

If this value is `false` it indicates that if the image data is changed, it will impact any data within the chunk, and therefore the chunk should not be blindly copied to a new PNG data stream. If an encoder understands this chunk, on the other hand, it is free to make necessary modifications and copy the chunk.
