# FrameControl.DelayDenominator property

The denominator of the delay fraction; indicating the time to display the current frame, in seconds.

```csharp
public ushort DelayDenominator { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

If the denominator is `0`, it is to be treated as if it were `100` (that is, the numerator then specifies 1/100ths of a second).
