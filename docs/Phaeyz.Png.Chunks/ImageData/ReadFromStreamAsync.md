# ImageData.ReadFromStreamAsync method

Reads the chunk from the stream, hydrating the properties of the chunk.

```csharp
public override ValueTask ReadFromStreamAsync(MarshalStream stream, int chunkLength, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| stream | The stream to read from. |
| chunkLength | The length of the chunk data on the stream. |
| cancellationToken | A cancellation token which may be used to cancel the operation. |

## Return Value

A task which is completed when the chunk has been read.

## Remarks

It is expected that the method reads exactly *chunkLength* bytes from the stream. If less or more is read, it will lead to corruption.
