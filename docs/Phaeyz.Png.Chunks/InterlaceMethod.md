# InterlaceMethod enumeration

The transmission order of the image data.

```csharp
public enum InterlaceMethod : byte
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Null | `0` | Pixels are extracted sequentially from left to right, and scanlines sequentially from top to bottom. The interlaced PNG image is a single reduced image. |
| Adam7 | `1` | Defines seven distinct passes over the image. Each pass transmits a subset of the pixels in the reference image. The pass in which each pixel is transmitted (numbered from 1 to 7) is defined by replicating the following 8-by-8 pattern over the entire image, starting at the upper left corner. |
