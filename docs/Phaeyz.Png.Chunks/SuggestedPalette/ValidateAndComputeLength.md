# SuggestedPalette.ValidateAndComputeLength method

Validates all properties of the chunk such that the chunk is ready for serialization, and computes the data length of the chunk.

```csharp
public override int ValidateAndComputeLength()
```

## Return Value

The data length of the chunk. It must match exactly the number of bytes that [`WriteToStreamAsync`](../../Phaeyz.Png/Chunk/WriteToStreamAsync.md) would write.

## Remarks

This method is not called if the chunk does not have length.
