# FrameBlendBehavior enumeration

Specifies whether the frame is to be alpha blended into the current output buffer content, or whether it should completely replace its region in the output buffer.

```csharp
public enum FrameBlendBehavior : byte
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overwrite | `0` | All color components of the frame, including alpha, overwrite the current contents of the frame's output buffer region. |
| AlphaBlend | `1` | The frame should be composited onto the output buffer based on its alpha, using a simple "OVER" operation as described in ([Alpha Channel Processing](https://www.w3.org/TR/png-3/#13Alpha-channel-processing)). Note that the second variation of the sample code is applicable. |

## Remarks

For the first frame, the two blend modes are functionally equivalent due to the clearing of the output buffer at the beginning of each play.
