# FrameAreaDisposal enumeration

The type of frame area disposal to be done after rendering this frame; in other words, it specifies how the output buffer should be changed at the end of the delay (before rendering the next frame).

```csharp
public enum FrameAreaDisposal : byte
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `0` | No disposal is done on this frame before rendering the next; the contents of the output buffer are left as is. |
| Background | `1` | The frame's region of the output buffer is to be cleared to fully transparent black before rendering the next frame. |
| Previous | `2` | The frame's region of the output buffer is to be reverted to the previous contents before rendering the next frame. |
